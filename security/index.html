	<h2>Comp20 Assignment 4 </h2>
	<h4>Danielle Westerman
		<br>Assessing Gabriel Terrel's Marauder's Map</h4>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<div id="bodies">
	<p>My goal is to assess the security and privacy of Gabriel Terrell’s
	   Marauder’s Map assignment. The Marauder’s Map takes in location data
	   for all of its users, storing all of their positions in a database
	   and displaying them on a map. Both the client-side (assignment 2)
	   and the server-side (assignment 3) show severe security
	   vulnerabilities, which allow malicious hackers to interfere with
	   the functionality and potentially launch attacks on users of the
	   application.</p>
	</div>


	<h3>Methodology</h3>
	<div id="bodies">
	<p>In finding security flaws in the Marauder’s map, I primarily used curl
		in the terminal to manipulate posting data to the server.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
	<div id="bodies">
	<p>	The security and privacy issues are due to the fact that, contrary to
		Ming’s advice, the server trusted the user to input legal data.
		Hackers and malicious users can easily violate this trust and enter
		harmful input that can change the functionality of the website,
		manipulate the data stored in the website, and show important
		information to others who should not have access to it. </p>
	</div>

	<h3>Issues Found</h3>
	<div id="bodies">
	<ol>
		<li> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) </li>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Location:</b> This attack is launched when a user inputs
				information through the HTTP POST API. However, the result of
				this attack is not seen until an HTTP GET request is executed
			</li>
			<li><b>Severity: </b>High- this type of vulnerability allows
				hackers to inject any type of code, changing
				the behavior of the website and even leaving
				users vulnerable to dangerous attacks</li>
			<li><b>Description: </b>When data is submitted through the 
				post API, it is received as a string of text, and the contents
				of the input are later displayed on the webpage. However, if
				this text contains code (such as &lt;script&gt;alert(‘hello’)
				&lt;/script&gt; as below), this code will be executed and thus
				the site’s functionality can be completely changed or destroyed
				if that is the hacker’s intent. This vulnerability was found
				using curl to send data to the post API (/sendLocation), where
				the ‘login’ field was filled with JavaScript code.</li>
			<li><b>Proof of Vulnerability: </b>
				<br> Curl-ing "&lt;script&gt;alert(‘hello’)&lt;/script&gt;" as
				the login name to the send API: <br>
				<img src="xss_terminal.jpg">
				 <br> Result:<br>
				<img src="xss_alert.jpg"></li>
			<li><b>Resolution: </b> Since a server cannot do anything to
				control what its users submit, it must check the data for
				potential XSS attacks. By 'sanitizing' the input, the server
				can protect itself from code injections by changing key
				characters (such as &lt; and &gt;) to &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; so
				the input will not be recognized as executable code. This can
				be performed as soon as the server receives the data, before it
				is stored, so as to avoid any complications that may arise from
				storing malicious code and escaping it only just before it is
				sent back out. </li> 

		</ul>
		<li>Extra JSON fields</li>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Location:</b> This attack is launched through the HTTP POST
				API.</li>
			<li><b>Severity: </b> Low- since the GET API only deals with 'login,'
				'lat,' and 'lng' fields from the input, any information entered
				in extraneous fields will not be executed. However, when taken
				to extreme lengths, this kind of attack can fill up the database,
				severely slowing down performance and possibly costing the server
				extra money. </li>
			<li><b>Description:</b>When submitting data via the POST API,
				different fields are entered using the format "key=value" and
				separated by a &amp;. A hacker can enter any data fields he or
				she wants to, other than the login, lat, and lng expected by
				the server. The server will only use those three inputs,
				although it reads in anything and everything that a user
				enters. </li>
			<li><b>Proof of Vulnerability: </b></li>
			<li><b>Resolution: </b></li> 
			</ul>
		<li> No user authentication</li>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Location:</b> This attack </li>
			<li><b>Severity: </b> Medium- Anyone with internet access can
				access the map with whatever name and coordinates they choose.
			</li>
			<li><b>Description:</b>Because users are not required to
				authenticate their identity, any internet user in any location
				can access the information in the database. This is a huge
				breach of privacy, although this particular privacy flaw does
				not allow hackers to harm the server. </li>
			<li><b>Proof of Vulnerability: </b></li>
			<li><b>Resolution: </b></li> 
			</ul>

	</ol>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<div id="bodies">
		<p> Overall, this web application is generally not very secure at all.
			Because sensitive information (like a user's location) is available
			to anyone who accesses the URL, all users' privacy is at risk.
			Because the server does not escape users' input before it is added
			to the database, a malicious hacker can easily hijack the
			application via cross-site scripting. Many of this application's
			security problems can easily be fixed by cleaning user's input,
			adding extra precautions to verify a user's identity and only allow
			database information to be viewed by those it is intended for.
