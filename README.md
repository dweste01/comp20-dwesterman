This Github repository is the home of project completed for Comp 20 (Web Programming
 in the spring of 2015, taught by Ming Chow at Tufts University. 

My favorite assignment was the Marauder's Map, because it was the first 'big' project
in this class in which we were granted some freedom and creativity (rather than the
smaller labs, whose function was to teach us a particular skill and there was really
only one way to implement them correctly). It was around the time of this project
that I became comfortable with the material, and felt like I could make slightly
more complicated web apps.

Since the beginning of this course, I have not only learned new languages, skills,
and concepts (HTML/CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, external APIs, etc.), I've also gotten
much better at troubleshooting and searching for answers and have a better overall
intuition.

I think the most important thing I learned was how to have apps that can have a
visual aspect rather than just spitting out text. In most other classes (11, 15,
40, 105, etc.) almost all of the project deal only with the terminal, rather
than having actual images on a canvas. the JavaScript canvas function that we
learned about, as well as using APIs to incorporate external apps taught me how
to create apps that are more like what we see in the real world.

In the future I would like to learn more about front-end interface design. While
back-end is obviously important to have a functioning web app, now that I have
some experience with it, I would like to learn more about creating a nice,
crisp, professional front-end for users to interact with.
